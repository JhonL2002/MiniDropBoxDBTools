"Data Migration Assistant - Assessment Report:"
"The analysis of your source SQL Server databases is complete. Based on your source server and which target server you plan to migrate, the below list can contain compatibility issues, breaking changes, behavior changes and deprecated features. While these issues may not prevent you from migrating to the target SQL Server platform, some of the breaking changes and deprecated features may disrupt your applications. We recommend addressing these compatibility issues before moving your database to production. 
We also analyzed the databases and tables in your source server to provide a report on new SQL Server feature recommendations that might be applicable to your database environment. Implementing the below suggested recommendations would enhance your SQL Server experience and may also bring potential cost-savings and better performance."

SQL Server Agent jobs are not available in Azure SQL Database.","Use Elastic Database Jobs (preview), which are the replacement for SQL Server Agent jobs in Azure SQL Database. Elastic Database Jobs for Azure SQL Database allow you to reliably execute T-SQL scripts that span multiple databases while automatically retrying and providing eventual completion guarantees.  Alternatively consider migrating to Azure SQL Managed Instance or SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines.","Getting started with Elastic Database Jobs (Preview) (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/elastic-jobs-overview)"
